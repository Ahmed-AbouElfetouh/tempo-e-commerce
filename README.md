#  Tempo E-Commerce
I built this project using (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).

So What you will find in my project? :

-All website's Products rendered by JavaScript.

- A Fixed Navbar appears when you scroll to a specific position in Shop Page.

- When you click on every product it will open another Page containing this product details.

- When you click on (add to cart) button the cart will and this product will add to cart.

- You can Decrease and Increase product Quantity.

- When you add the same product again his quantity in the cart will increase by one.

- When you Decrease and Increase product Quantity the Subtotal changes as well.

- You can remove the Product from the cart when his quantity is less than zero.

- All those operations saved at Local Storage.
